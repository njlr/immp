# Insurgency Modular Map Project

The *Insurgency Modular Map Project* is collection of prefabs for [Insurgency](http://www.playinsurgency.com/) by New World Interactive. By providing high quality pre-made assets—such as buildings, rock formations and walls—IMMP will allow the community to quickly experiment with new layouts and ideas. 

This project is not affiliated with New World Interactive. 

## Get Started

For general guidance on Insurgency mapping, see the [official tutorial](http://insurgency.gamebanana.com/tuts/11647) on GameBanana. 

Assets can be imported using a `func_instance` object. 

 1. Create a new point entity
 2. Change the type to `func_instance`
 3. Set the VMF path to the point to the asset file you want to embed
 4. Move and rotate the asset as you would a prop
